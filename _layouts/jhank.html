<h4>JHANK (Under Construction)</h4>
<div class="norm">I am developing yet another toolkit to solve discrete-time Heterogeneous-Agent New-Keynesian (HANK) models relatively easily, available in <emph>Fortran 90</emph>, <emph>Julia</emph>, and <emph>Matlab</emph>. The toolbox itself and a companion paper describing the model and giving an overview of the solution method will be posted here soon. Comments and suggestions are welcome!</div>
