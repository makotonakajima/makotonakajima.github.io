<h4>JHANK</h4>
<div class="norm">I am developing yet another toolkit to solve discrete-time Heterogeneous-Agent New-Keynesian (HANK) model relatively easily, available in Fortran 90, Julia, and Matlab. The toolbox itself and a companion paper describing the model and giving an overview of the solution method will be posted here soon. Comments and suggestions are welcome!</div>
